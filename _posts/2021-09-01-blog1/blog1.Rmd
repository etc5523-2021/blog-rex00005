# What is Coronavirus
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It has brought a global pandemic since December 2019. Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention.


## How it spreads

According to the WHO, the virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are near someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth. The virus spreads more easily indoors and in crowded settings. Therefore, do not gathering, and wearing a mask is essential.

# Data Description

The data used for this article is obtained from [RamiKrispin's github Resitory]('https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus/blob/master/data/coronavirus.rda'), and [Our World in Data](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv). 

The raw data of **coronavirus data set** contains `r nrow(coronavirus)` rows and `r ncol(coronavirus)` columns of data. And the second data set contains `r nrow(sa)` rows and `r ncol(sa)` columns of data. After the data cleaning, the variables used is shown in the following data dictionary.

```{r echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

# Overview of the situation in Middle East

"The storm will pass, humankind will survive, most of us will still be alive, but we will inhabit a different world (Dorsey, 2020)."

It is clear that the world will not be the same after this pandemic. Till now, the world has confirmed 219 million infected cases and 4.55 million deaths. This article will mainly focus the coronavirus situation in Saudi Arabia. Let's first have an overview on the situation in the Middle East.

```{r}
#list of middle east countries
mideastname <- c("Bahrain",
 "Cyprus",
 "Egypt",
 "Iran",
 "Iraq",
 "Israel",
 "Jordan",
 "Kuwait",
 "Lebanon",
 "Oman",
 "Qatar",
 "Saudi Arabia",
 "Syria",
 "Turkey",
 "United Arab Emirates",
 "Yemen")
```


```{r}
cases <- coronavirus %>% 
  group_by(country, long, lat) %>% 
  summarise(cases = sum(cases)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(country %in% mideastname)

```

```{r}
world <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf") %>% select(name, pop_est)
world_join <-  left_join(world, cases, by = c("name" = "country")) 
plot_world_join <- world_join %>% 
  mutate(`Cases in thousands` = cases/1000)
```


```{r}
plot <- ggplot(data =  plot_world_join)+
	geom_sf(mapping = aes(geometry = geometry,fill = `Cases in thousands`)) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(25, 62.5), 
		ylim = c(12.4, 43, 
		expand = TRUE))+
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "grey", mid = "white", high = "#e76f3c", midpoint = .02)+
  geom_label_repel(data = cases, 
		aes( long,  lat, label = country), 
		color = "black", 
		fontface = "bold", 
		size = 2.5, 
		force = 50)+
	theme_minimal() +
	theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "aliceblue"), 
		legend.position = "right") +
	ggtitle("Figure1: Map of Middle East Covid-19 Infection Situation") +

Though the Coronavirus has been wreaking havoc across the world for more than 1 year. Some countries managed to successfully slow the infection and keep mortality rates low, while others acted too slowly and ineffectively and consequently paid a huge price. Taking a look at the Covid-19 situation in the Middle East area, it's not hard to see that the Southern part of the Middle East countries have significant less infection cases compared with the northerners, such as Turkey and Iran. However, when considering the effectiveness of a country's epidemic prevention, population size should be taken into account as well. For now, let's have a look what kind of responses theses countries has imposed.


## The threats and responses

### The UAE and Saudi Arabia

The UAE and Saudi Arabia have reacted pre-emptively and have contributed to flattening the curve of infections in their countries. The United Arab Emirates has been implementing social distancing measures. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, adopted an aggressive approach towards the virus, including a curfew from dusk to dawn. 


### Iran
Iran’s belated response and initial denials have transformed it into the epicenter of the Covid-19 pandemic in the Middle East with tens of thousands of infections. The first reported Covid-19 deaths in the MENA region occurred in the Iranian holy city of Qom when two pilgrims died as a result of the virus. Despite this knowledge, Iran's refusal to impose a lockdown on its population in February 2020, has allowed the virus to spread into other countries, including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Kuwait and Lebanon (Frantzman, 2020).

### Turkey
Iran is not the only country that had false cognition on the coronavirus situation. When the virus first appeared in Turkey, the government underestimated the spread speed of the virus and did not imposed any social mobility, which made its densely populated cities vulerable. Also, the medical system in Turkey was challenged.


## Covid-19 cases statistics


```{r}
rank <- c("7","6","5","10", "9", "11","12","4","13","8","3","16","15","14","2","1")
```



```{r}
mideast <- world %>% 
  filter(name %in% mideastname)
table_mideast <- coronavirus %>% 
  right_join(mideast, by = c("country" = "name")) %>% 
  group_by(country, pop_est) %>%
  summarise(cases = sum(cases)) %>% 
  mutate(`Infection Rate %` = round(100*cases/pop_est, 2)) %>%  
  arrange(desc(cases)) %>% 
  mutate(cases = scales::comma(cases)) %>%
  rename("Country" = country,  "Population"= pop_est, "Total Number of Infection" = cases) 
table_mideast$`Rank of the Lowest Infection Rate` <- rank
```

```{r}
table_mideast %>% 
  kable(caption = "This table displays the Covid-19 infection situation in the 16 middle east countries.", 
        align = "c") %>%  
  row_spec(0, color = "white", background = "#e76f3c") %>% 
  row_spec(8, background = "#e7a83c") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 12) %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "400px") 
```

Not surprisingly, Turkey and Iran are ranked the top 2 in terms of the number of infection cases, given the knowledge from the previous news story about how they responded to the pandemic. Yemen has recorded the lowest confirmed cases, which is over 1/650 of the number of cases in Turkey. Saudi Arabia has recorded around 551,000 cases, which is ranked in the middle of the 16 countries. However, when we take the population into account, Saudi Arabia has ranked the 4th in terms of the epidemic prevention. Turkey is ranked the 7th in terms of lower infection rate when taking account the population. It is noted that Yemen still outperforms the other countries in terms of the infection rate.

# Situation in Saudi Arabia
Until 31 August 2021, the total Covid-19 infection cases in Saudi Arabia have reached 550,000. Within the total infection cases, 8400 cases are recorded as death, which means the mortality rate in Saudi Arabia is 1.5%. This is actually lower than the global average morality rate of 2% according to the statistics from Wikipedia. Note that the marginal increase in death keeps decreasing since the peak in June 2020. Also, he new confirmed cases has dropped since July 2020, but climb up again in this year. This agree with the excellent health system that Saudi Arabia has, but the pandemic is still not under control. However, we are glad to see that the very recent August data shows the newly confirmed cases has significantly decrease to half of the increase in the previous month. 


```{r}


cov_sa <- sa %>% 
  filter(location %in% "Saudi Arabia") %>% 
  select(date, total_cases, new_cases,new_cases_smoothed, total_deaths,new_deaths, new_deaths_smoothed
) %>% 
  na.omit() %>% transform(date = as.yearmon(date)) 


  
  
```


```{r}
dt1 <- cov_sa %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  filter(date != "Sep 2021") %>% 
  summarise(avg_total_cases = scales::comma(round(mean(total_cases))),
            avg_new_cases = scales::comma(round(mean(new_cases))),
            new_cases_trend = spk_chr(new_cases, type = "line"),
            avg_total_deaths = scales::comma(round(mean(total_deaths))),
            avg_new_deaths = round(mean(new_deaths)),
            new_deaths_trend = spk_chr(new_deaths, type = "line")) %>% 
  mutate(date = as.character(date)) 

```


```{r, fig.cap= "The new confirmed cases trend was decreasing since July 2020. However, the trend climb back in Jan 2021. It is noted that the marginal increase in death is decreasing since June 2020"}
datatable(dt1, escape = FALSE, 
            options = list(fnDrawCallback = 
                             htmlwidgets::JS('function(){HTMLWidgets.staticRender();}'), pageLength = 8,
                           className = 'dt-center', targets = 7, 
                           initComplete = JS(
    "function(settings, json) {",
    "$(this.api().table().header()).css({'background-color': '#e76f3c', 'color': '#fff'});",
    "}")), 
            colnames = c("Month", "Total Cases", "New Cases", "New Cases Trend","Total Deaths", "New Deaths", "New Deaths Trend")) %>%
  spk_add_deps()
```
