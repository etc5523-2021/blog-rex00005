This article will statistically explore the coronavirus situations in the middle east area and especially in the United Arab Emirates, as well as how the United Arab Emirates fought this pandemic.

# Data description

The data used for this article is obtained from [Our World in Data](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv). 

The data set contains `r nrow(owid)` rows and `r ncol(owid)` columns of data. After the data cleaning, the variables used is shown in the following data dictionary.

```{r echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
description <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("date","location","total_cases","new_cases",
               "total_deaths","new_deaths",

# Data Story 1

## Overview Covid-19 situation in Middle East and UAE





```{r}
mideast <- owid %>% 
  filter(location %in% mideastname)%>% 
  select(iso_code, location, date, total_cases, new_cases,
         new_deaths, total_deaths) %>% 
   filter(date == '2020-01-31'|date =='2020-02-28'|date =='2020-03-31'|date =='2020-04-30'|date =='2020-05-31'|date =='2020-06-30'|date =='2020-07-31'|date =='2020-08-31'|date =='2020-09-30'|date =='2020-10-31'|date =='2020-11-30'|date =='2020-12-31'|date =='2021-01-31'|date =='2021-02-28'|date =='2021-03-31'|date =='2021-04-30'|date =='2021-05-31'|date =='2021-06-30'|date =='2021-07-31'|date =='2021-08-31')
```



```{r, fig.width = 8}
map <- mideast %>% 
  select(date, location, total_cases, iso_code) %>% 
  mutate(hover = paste0(location, "\n", "Cases:", "\n",total_cases)) 

graph = plot_geo(map,
                 locations = ~mideastname,
                 frame = ~date) %>% 
  add_trace(locations = ~iso_code,
            z = ~total_cases,
            zmin = 0,
            zmax = max(map$total_cases),
            color = ~total_cases,
            text = ~hover,
            hoverinfo = 'text') %>% 
  layout(geo = list( fitbounds = "locations"),
         title = "Number of confirmed cases in Middle East") %>% 
  colorbar(title = "Total cases confirmed")

graph
```

By clicking on the `Play` button, the graph shows an animation on how the total number of covid confirmed cases changed in the middle east area. We can see that the overall infections in the middle east area remained low until end of the year 2020. In Dec 2020, the situation in Turkey starts to outbreak and lose control, and it is followed by Iran. As for the United Arab Emirates, we can see that it remains low infections compared to its neighbour countries in the middle east area. 


## Covid-19 in UAE
```{r}

uae <- mideast %>% 
  filter(location %in% "United Arab Emirates")
uae_trend <-uae %>% 
  select(location, date, new_cases, new_deaths) %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))

uae_week <- uae  %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %>% 
  mutate(week = floor_date(date, "week")) %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  summarise(new_cases = mean(new_cases),
            new_deaths = mean(new_deaths))

```


```{r}
p3 <- uae_week %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week,
             y = new_cases)) +
  geom_col(fill = "light grey")+
  geom_line(data = uae_trend, aes(x = date, y = new_cases),
            color = "#e76f3c",size = 1)+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Trend of daily & weekly average cases",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Number of cases confirmed")+
  annotate("text",
           x = as.Date("2021-03-28"),
           y = 3300,
           label = "daily cases",
           color = "grey")+
  annotate("text",
           x = as.Date("2020-05-31"),
           y = 1000,
           label = "Weekly average trend",
           color = "#e76f3c")
ggplotly(p3)



```
```{r}
p4 <- uae_week %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week,
             y = new_deaths)) +
  geom_col(fill = "light grey")+
  geom_line(data = uae_trend, aes(x = date, y = new_deaths),
            color = "#e76f3c",size = 1)+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Trend of daily & weekly average deaths",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Number of deaths")+
  annotate("text",
           x = as.Date("2021-03-31"),
           y = 12,
           label = "daily deaths")+
  annotate("text",
           x = as.Date("2020-04-26"),
           y = 8,
           label = "Weekly average trend",
           color = "grey")
  
ggplotly(p4)



```

The above figures futher explore the daily and weekly trend of the case confirmed and deaths in the United Arab Emirates.

The UAE response rapidly to the covid. One of the leading countries in the covid test around the world.
